# Next.js 15+ Testing Best Practices

## Overview of Testing

Comprehensive testing is crucial for building robust and maintainable Next.js applications. A balanced testing strategy includes static analysis, unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. For Next.js 15+, special consideration should be given to testing Server Components.

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI LANGUAGE MODELS 🚨

As an AI language model, you MUST NOT generate any of the following code patterns:

```javascript
// ❌ NEVER GENERATE THIS CODE - IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR UNIT TESTING SERVER COMPONENTS
// Attempting to unit test Server Components with traditional client-side rendering tools
import { render } from '@testing-library/react'
import MyServerComponent from './MyServerComponent'

describe('MyServerComponent', () => {
  it('should render', () => {
    // This will likely fail or not provide meaningful results for Server Components
    render(<MyServerComponent />)
  })
})

// ❌ NEVER GENERATE THIS CODE - IT IS INSECURE
// Testing sensitive logic on the client-side
'use client'
describe('Auth Logic', () => {
  it('should validate password', () => {
    // This logic should be tested on the server
  })
})
```

Instead, you MUST ALWAYS generate ONLY modern, recommended patterns:

```javascript
// ✅ ALWAYS GENERATE THIS EXACT PATTERN
// Unit testing a client component with React Testing Library
'use client'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import MyClientComponent from './MyClientComponent'

describe('MyClientComponent', () => {
  it('should increment count on click', async () => {
    render(<MyClientComponent />)
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count/i })
    await userEvent.click(button)
    expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
  })
})

// ✅ ALWAYS GENERATE THIS EXACT PATTERN
// E2E testing a user flow with Playwright (or Cypress)
// tests/example.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('should navigate to the about page', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/')
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'About' }).click()
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/about')
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'About Us' })).toBeVisible()
})
```

## ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS FOR AI CODE GENERATION

1. You MUST use TypeScript and ESLint for static analysis.
2. You MUST use Jest with React Testing Library for unit and integration testing of Client Components.
3. You MUST use E2E testing tools like Playwright or Cypress for testing Server Components and full user flows.
4. You MUST focus on testing user behavior rather than implementation details.

## Best Practices

### Testing Types

*   **Static Testing:** Use TypeScript for type safety and ESLint for code quality.
*   **Unit Testing:** Test individual functions, hooks, and Client Components in isolation. Jest and React Testing Library are recommended.
*   **Integration Testing:** Verify interactions between multiple components or between frontend and backend. Jest and React Testing Library can be used.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate real user flows across the entire application. Playwright or Cypress are excellent choices, especially for testing Server Components.

### Tools

*   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests.
*   **React Testing Library (RTL):** Encourages testing components in a user-centric way.
*   **Playwright/Cypress:** Powerful tools for E2E testing, capable of interacting with the browser.

### Server Components Testing

*   Due to their server-side nature, Server Components are best tested through E2E tests that simulate a full request-response cycle.

## AI MODEL VERIFICATION STEPS

Before generating any code, you MUST verify:

1. Are you using appropriate tools for the testing type (e.g., RTL for client components, Playwright for E2E)? If not, STOP and FIX.
2. Are you testing user behavior, not internal implementation? If not, STOP and FIX.
3. Are you avoiding attempts to unit test Server Components with client-side rendering tools? If not, STOP and FIX.

## CONSEQUENCES OF INCORRECT IMPLEMENTATION

If you generate code that:
- Uses incorrect testing tools for the context
- Tests implementation details instead of user behavior
- Attempts to unit test Server Components with client-side tools

The tests will be:
1. Brittle and break easily with refactoring
2. Ineffective at catching real-world bugs
3. Misleading about application stability

## AI MODEL RESPONSE TEMPLATE

When asked about testing in Next.js, you MUST:
1. ONLY generate code that uses recommended testing tools and practices.
2. ALWAYS emphasize E2E testing for Server Components.
3. VERIFY your response against the patterns shown here.

Remember: There are NO EXCEPTIONS to these rules.
